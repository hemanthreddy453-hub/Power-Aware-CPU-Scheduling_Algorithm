# Power-Aware-CPU-Scheduling_Algorithm
Project Overview:
The Power-Aware CPU Scheduling Algorithm focuses on optimizing CPU power consumption while ensuring that system performance is maintained. By prioritizing processes based on their burst times, the algorithm reduces the overall energy consumption without compromising on task execution time. It is particularly beneficial for battery-operated devices and energy-efficient systems, where minimizing power usage is crucial.

Key Features:
Power Optimization: Prioritizes shorter burst-time processes to reduce power consumption.

Process Scheduling: Implements Shortest Job First (SJF) to optimize the order of tasks based on burst time.

Dynamic Power Calculation: Tracks power consumption in real-time based on the burst times of processes.

Execution Time Management: Minimizes idle CPU time to reduce overall power usage.

Visualization: Provides graphical representations of process execution and power consumption over time.

Technologies Used:
Python: For implementing the algorithm, performing simulations, and visualizations.


Random Library: For generating random burst times of processes for simulation.

Time Library: To simulate process execution times and track overall time and power consumption.

Usage:
Battery-Powered Devices: Used in mobile devices, laptops, and wearables to optimize energy usage while maintaining performance.

Data Centers: Helps optimize power consumption in large-scale server systems where power efficiency is critical.

Embedded Systems: Applied in embedded systems where power efficiency is a major concern due to resource constraints.
